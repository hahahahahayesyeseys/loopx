"""Guard the guided flow when Goal state outlives its registry entry (#4801).

A reset that removes a Goal from ``.loopx/registry.json`` but leaves its
``ACTIVE_GOAL_STATE.md`` behind is not ordinary absence. Continuing with the
normal bootstrap, agent-registration, Todo, quota, or host-activation
continuation would let a fresh lane write over the orphaned state under the same
human-readable id, and ``diagnose`` would then report a healthy Goal.
